[h1]Browser2[/h1]
The [b]Browser2[/b] object accesses features of the browser or platform running the project. It also provides features like switching to and from fullscreen mode, detecting if an update is available, and determining if the page is visible.

Security limitations sometimes prevent browser actions. For example, the window Close action can only be used when the window was created by a JavaScript window.open call.

[b]Javascript[/b]: Only use if necessary. Instead recommend to use [url=https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/scripting/overview]scripting feature[/url] or [url=https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/addon-sdk]Addon SDK[/url]. Wherever possible, prefer to write your JavaScript code using one of the above options rather than using the Browser object.

[h2]Browser2 conditions:[/h2]
[dl sans-serif]
	[dt]On back button[/dt]
	[dd]Triggered when the user presses the device's Back button. Note not all devices have this button (e.g. iOS devices only have a Home button) and not all platforms support this trigger.[/dd]
	
	[dt]On went online[/dt]
	[dt]On went offline[/dt]
	[dd]Triggered when the browser thinks the connection to the Internet has become available or unavailable during the running of the game. This is common on mobile devices which may be moving in and out of signal areas. The Is online condition also changes to reflect the connection status.[warning]The "is online" detection of the Browser plugin is more or less a guess. It is actually difficult to categorically determine if an Internet connection is available. For example the user may have intermittent signal, and online features sometimes work and sometimes fail unpredictably. In this case the "Is online" detection is probably wrong, as it can't actually tell whether a connection will work. Rather than using this condition to check if online features will work, usually it's better to just go ahead and use online features anyway as if the user is online, and handle any errors that occur as a result.[/warning][/dd]
	
	[dt]Is online[/dt]
	[dd]True if the browser thinks it currently has an active connection to the Internet.
